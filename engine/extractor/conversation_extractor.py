"""
Conversation Extractor v2 — extracts RICH knowledge from conversations.

Extracts:
1. Entities (any type: person, project, technology, company, concept, place, activity, event, etc.)
2. Facts — short assertions
3. Relations — connections between entities
4. Knowledge — solutions, formulas, recipes, configs, commands (with artifacts)

Knowledge is the killer feature. LLM determines the knowledge type:
  [solution] — problem solution (code, config)
  [formula] — formula, equation
  [treatment] — treatment, prescription
  [experiment] — experiment result
  [recipe] — recipe (cooking, process)
  [decision] — decision made
  [command] — useful command / instruction
  [reference] — link, source
  [insight] — observation, insight
  [example] — example, case
  ... any other type that fits the context

EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge extraction system. Extract personal knowledge from ALL speakers in the conversation.

Return ONLY valid JSON without markdown.

WHO TO EXTRACT ABOUT:
- Extract facts about ALL people mentioned — both speakers share equally important information
- Extract identity, preferences, activities, relationships, plans, events for every person
- If someone says "I went to a support group" — extract it as a fact about THAT person
- DO NOT extract: generic knowledge the AI assistant explained (unless a person confirmed they use it)
- If a person says "I"/"me"/"my" — resolve to their name if known, otherwise "User"

SPEAKER vs THIRD-PARTY DISAMBIGUATION:
- There are exactly TWO participants in this conversation (user messages and assistant messages)
- When a speaker says "I have a pet" or "I read a book" → that fact belongs to THAT SPEAKER, not to any third party
- Third-party people (authors, friends, relatives mentioned by name) get their own entities ONLY for facts directly ABOUT them
  Example: "I read Becoming Nicole by Amy Ellis Nutt" → fact "read Becoming Nicole" belongs to the SPEAKER
  Amy Ellis Nutt entity should ONLY get: "author of the book Becoming Nicole"
- NEVER attribute a speaker's personal experiences, possessions, or activities to a mentioned third party
- If Speaker A says "my guinea pig Oscar" → Oscar belongs to Speaker A, NOT to anyone else mentioned in conversation
- NEVER infer anyone's identity from URLs, repo paths, or package names: "DietrichGebert/ponytail" is a repo
  owned by GitHub user DietrichGebert — it does NOT mean any speaker IS or knows Dietrich Gebert
- Do NOT create person entities from usernames in URLs/repo paths/package names unless the conversation
  states facts directly ABOUT that person
{existing_context}
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
- Messages may contain "[Shared image: <description>]" — treat as REAL content the person shared
- Extract facts from image descriptions combined with surrounding conversation
- Example: "[Shared image: a black and white bowl]" during pottery discussion → "made a black and white bowl in pottery class"
- Example: "[Shared image: a book cover]" → extract the book title if identifiable from context

ENTITY RULES:
- Named entities with 1+ extractable facts (people, places, organizations, activities, projects)
- entity_type: a descriptive type (e.g. person, project, technology, company, concept, place, activity, event, book, tool, etc.)
- Create separate entities for each person by name
- Single-fact entities are OK if the fact is important (identity, job, location, hobby)

ENTITY NAMING:
- EXACT casing from context: "Mengram" not "MENGRAM", "PostgreSQL" not "postgresql"
- FULL name when known: "Ali Baizhanov" not "Ali", "Uzum Bank" not "uzum"
- If entity already exists above — use EXACT SAME NAME (do not create duplicates)

FACT RULES:
- Concise but COMPLETE — preserve ALL specific details (names, titles, numbers, brands, breeds, instruments)
- Prefer 10-25 words per fact. Longer is OK if needed to preserve critical specifics.
- ALWAYS include dates/times when mentioned or inferrable from context
  GOOD: "attended LGBTQ support group on May 7, 2023"
  GOOD: "started pottery class in June 2023"
  GOOD: "works as a software engineer at Google"
  BAD: "attended support group" (date was available but omitted!)
- TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS MANDATORY when date context exists:
  - "[8 May, 2023]" + "yesterday" → calculate: "May 7, 2023"
  - "[June 15]" + "last week" → calculate: "approximately June 8, 2023"
  - "[Oct 2023]" + "last year" → use "2022"
  - "[July 3]" + "two days ago" → calculate: "July 1, 2023"
  ALWAYS do the arithmetic — never output relative references like "yesterday" or "last week"
- The "when" field MUST be an absolute date when determinable (e.g. "2023-05-07", "June 2023", "2023")
- ONLY facts that DIRECTLY describe the entity they're assigned to
- Keep project facts on projects, personal facts on the person — don't mix
- DO NOT extract: meta-conversation actions ("asked a question", "sent a message", "said hello")
- Facts can optionally include a "when" date field (see format below)

DETAIL PRESERVATION — these details are ALWAYS worth keeping in facts:
- Book/movie/show/song titles: "reading Charlotte's Web" not "reading a book"
- Instrument/sport/hobby specifics: "plays clarinet and violin" not "plays instruments"
- Pet breed/species and names: "has a guinea pig named Patches" not "has a pet"
- Food/cuisine specifics: "favorite dish is pad thai" not "likes Asian food"
- Place names: "visited the Louvre" not "visited a museum"
- Quantities and measurements: "ran a 5K" not "went running", "has 3 children" not "has children"
- People's full names: "met Dr. Sarah Chen" not "met a doctor"
- Symbols and descriptions: "rainbow flag tattoo" not "has a tattoo"

FACT DEDUP — check existing facts above. Do NOT re-extract facts that already exist (even if worded slightly differently).
If someone says "I use Python" and existing context already has "uses Python" → skip it.
If someone says "I switched from React to Svelte" and existing has "uses React" → extract "switched to Svelte" (this is NEW info).

EPISODIC MEMORY — extract events and interactions:
- An episode = something that HAPPENED: an activity, decision, milestone, trip, class, meetup, achievement
- Extract any event worth remembering — err on the side of inclusion
- Include: what happened (summary), details (context), result (outcome), who was involved (participants)
- Include "happened_at" date if known from conversation context (e.g. "2023-05-07")
- emotional_valence: positive, negative, neutral, mixed
- importance: 0.3 (minor) to 0.9 (major milestone)
- Do NOT create episodes for pure greetings or small talk with no content

PROCEDURAL MEMORY — extract workflows/processes:
- A procedure = a repeatable sequence of steps someone performs or described
- Only extract if there are 2+ concrete steps forming a workflow
- Include: name, trigger (when to use it), steps (ordered actions)
- Link to entities involved
- Extract from IMPLICIT workflows too ("first I do X, then Y, then Z")

EXTRACTION_PROMPT_V2 = """You are a knowledge extraction system. Extract personal knowledge from the User's perspective.

Return ONLY valid JSON without markdown.

WHO TO EXTRACT ABOUT:
- Extract facts about the User and real people/entities the User mentions
- The User's own statements ("I work at Google", "my dog is named Rex") → facts about the User
- The Assistant's research, explanations, and general knowledge are NOT facts about anyone — skip them
- ONLY extract from Assistant content if the User EXPLICITLY CONFIRMS it applies to them
  Example: Assistant says "React uses virtual DOM" → DO NOT extract
  Example: User says "yeah I use React with virtual DOM daily" → extract for User
- If someone says "I"/"me"/"my" — that's the User (resolve to their name if known, otherwise "User")
- Information from web searches, docs, tool outputs, or code analysis is NOT a personal fact

SPEAKER vs THIRD-PARTY DISAMBIGUATION:
- The User sends messages as "user" role. The Assistant sends messages as "assistant" role.
- When the User says "I have a pet" or "I read a book" → that fact belongs to the USER, not to any third party
- Third-party people (authors, friends, relatives mentioned by name) get their own entities ONLY for facts directly ABOUT them

  states facts directly ABOUT that person
{existing_context}
DO NOT EXTRACT — meta-conversation noise:
- Assistant's internal actions: "let me search", "I'll look into", "here's what I found"
- Tool/function call outputs, search results, code analysis by the Assistant
- Procedural filler: "Sure, I can help", "Let me explain", "Here's an overview"
- The User asking the Assistant to do something ("can you search for X", "help me with Y")
  — unless it reveals a personal fact about the User (e.g. "search for flights to Tokyo" → User plans to visit Tokyo)
- Any fact that describes what happened IN this conversation rather than about the real world

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
- Messages may contain "[Shared image: <description>]" — treat as REAL content the person shared
- Extract facts from image descriptions combined with surrounding conversation
- Example: "[Shared image: a black and white bowl]" during pottery discussion → "made a black and white bowl in pottery class"

  - "[8 May, 2023]" + "yesterday" → calculate: "May 7, 2023"
  - "[June 15]" + "last week" → calculate: "approximately June 8, 2023"
  - "[Oct 2023]" + "last year" → use "2022"
  - "[July 3]" + "two days ago" → calculate: "July 1, 2023"
  ALWAYS do the arithmetic — never output relative references like "yesterday" or "last week"
- The "when" field MUST be an absolute date when determinable (e.g. "2023-05-07", "June 2023", "2023")
- ONLY facts that DIRECTLY describe the entity they're assigned to
- Keep project facts on projects, personal facts on the person — don't mix
- Facts can optionally include a "when" date field (see format below)
- COMPOUND STATEMENTS = MULTIPLE FACTS. Extract EVERY claim, not just the novel one:
  "I already use pytest at work but want to try hypothesis for my side project"
  → fact 1: "uses pytest at work"
  → fact 2: "wants to try hypothesis for a side project"
  → fact 3: "has a side project"
  The word "already" does NOT mean skip — it means this is an established fact worth storing.

DETAIL PRESERVATION — these details are ALWAYS worth keeping in facts:
- Book/movie/show/song titles: "reading Charlotte's Web" not "reading a book"
- Instrument/sport/hobby specifics: "plays clarinet and violin" not "plays instruments"
- Pet breed/species and names: "has a guinea pig named Patches" not "has a pet"
- Food/cuisine specifics: "favorite dish is pad thai" not "likes Asian food"
- Place names: "visited the Louvre" not "visited a museum"
- Quantities and measurements: "ran a 5K" not "went running", "has 3 children" not "has children"
- People's full names: "met Dr. Sarah Chen" not "met a doctor"
- Symbols and descriptions: "rainbow flag tattoo" not "has a tattoo"

QUALITY BAR — only extract facts worth recalling in a FUTURE conversation:
- YES: identity, preferences, skills, relationships, plans, locations, tools used
- YES: decisions made, problems solved, opinions expressed
- NO: transient actions ("searched for X", "looked at Y", "opened the file")
- NO: conversation mechanics ("thanked the assistant", "asked for help")
- NO: generic knowledge anyone could look up ("Python is a programming language")
- When in doubt about ASSISTANT content, skip it. Under-extraction of assistant noise is better than junk.
- BUT: the User's direct "I"/"my" statements are ALWAYS worth extracting — NEVER skip them.
  "I already use pytest at work" → MUST extract (uses pytest, works somewhere)
  "I have a side project" → MUST extract

FACT DEDUP — check existing facts above. Do NOT re-extract facts that already exist (even if worded slightly differently).
If someone says "I use Python" and existing context already has "uses Python" → skip it.
If someone says "I switched from React to Svelte" and existing has "uses React" → extract "switched to Svelte" (this is NEW info).

EPISODIC MEMORY — extract events and interactions:
- An episode = something that HAPPENED: an activity, decision, milestone, trip, class, meetup, achievement
- Only extract events from the REAL WORLD — not meta-conversation events
- Include: what happened (summary), details (context), result (outcome), who was involved (participants)
- Include "happened_at" date if known from conversation context (e.g. "2023-05-07")
- emotional_valence: positive, negative, neutral, mixed
- importance: 0.3 (minor) to 0.9 (major milestone)
- Do NOT create episodes for pure greetings, small talk, or "User asked Assistant to do X"

PROCEDURAL MEMORY — extract workflows/processes:
- A procedure = a repeatable sequence of steps someone performs or described
- Only extract if there are 2+ concrete steps forming a workflow
- Include: name, trigger (when to use it), steps (ordered actions)
- Link to entities involved
- Extract from IMPLICIT workflows too ("first I do X, then Y, then Z")

CRITICAL: Extract TOO MANY facts rather than too few. A missing fact can never be recovered, but a duplicate is cheaply deduplicated. When in doubt, EXTRACT IT.
